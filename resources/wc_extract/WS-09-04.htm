<p>Hear this, you who trample upon the needy, and bring the poor of the land to an end, saying, &quot;When will the new moon be over, that we may sell grain? And the sabbath, that we may offer wheat for sale, that we may make the ephah small and the shekel great, and deal deceitfully with false balances, that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and sell the refuse of the wheat?&quot; The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob, &quot;Surely I will never forget any of their deeds. Shall not the land tremble on this account, and every one mourn who dwells in it?&quot; </p>
<p>Judaism and Christianity. Amos 8.4-8 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>[Evil-doers] impoverish others for their own gain. For private ends they neglect public duties. They break into others' houses to take their property and valuables. They misdirect the water and light fires to destroy the people's homes. They upset others' plans so as to prevent their success. They spoil a worker's utensils to hamper his efficiency. With violence they seize, with violence they demand. They delight in fraud, they delight in robbery, they make raids and commit depradations to get rich. They shorten the foot, they narrow the measure, they lighten the scales, they reduce the peck. They adulterate the genuine, and they seek profit in illegitimate business. </p>

<p>O ye who believe! Devour not usury, doubling and quadrupling [the sum lent]. </p>
<p>Islam. Qur'an 3.130 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor, you shall not be to him as a creditor, and you shall not exact interest from him. </p>
<p>Judaism and Christianity. Exodus 22.25 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Do not men despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry? </p>
<p>Judaism and Christianity. Proverbs 6.30-31 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Qur'an 3.130: All modern societies agree that usury, when it is understood to mean charging exhorbitant interest, 'doubling and quadrupling,' is an evil whose prohibition is consistent with sound economics. But the absolute proscription of usury, when it is understood as prohibiting loaning money for any amount of interest whatsoever, has always proved difficult to practice in a mercantile economy. In the Islamic tradition, the wealthy will often make personal loans at no interest to those in need as a form of charity, but this does not apply to loans for business. Where there is a need to raise capital, either by entrepreneurs or by the state, loans are required, and people with capital will lend it only at a price. Therefore, both Christian and Muslim societies that have tried to enforce this prohibition have often winked at loopholes. One typical loophole is to permit loans from nonbelievers. Thus in Medieval Europe Jewish bankers were the accepted creditors for Christians, and today Western banks are often permitted to lend money in Islamic nations. Today, Islamic banks are developing new policies consistent with the Qur'an. Most notable of these is investment as profit sharing. Banks will lend to entrepreneurs in return for a percentage of the profits rather than for a fixed rate of interest. The bank then prospers as the business succeeds, but makes nothing should it fall into the red. Exodus 22.25: Lending at interest is prohibited specifically in the case where the borrower is poor. Cf. Exodus Rabbah 31.15, p. 177. Proverbs 6.30-31: In traditional Roman Catholic moral teaching, when a person is in dire need he may be justified in stealing food to keep from starving. In that case, food is regarded as 'common property.' Cf. Chuang Tzu 25, p. 1070. </p>
