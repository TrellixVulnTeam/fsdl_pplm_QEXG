<p>Fear, Submission, And Obedience </p>
</b></font><p>In this section are gathered representative passages on the fear of God, submission to God, and obedience to God's will. The fear of God sometimes means to serve God out of fear of punishment, as in the passage from the Upanishad on the fearsomeness of Shiva and from the African traditional ritual of Ofo. But usually the fear of God is a more exalted emotion, an awe and respect for Ultimate Reality who has graciously provided for our lives. Fear includes the notions of duty and loyalty to God, who is worthy of all service because of his continual blessings and help. It includes the idea of awe and respect, since God is awesome, mighty, and wonderful. It also includes the notions of shame and the fear of the consequences of sin, which guard people from unseemly behavior and sins which would cause injury to themselves. </p>
<p>Submission or surrender to God is a theme especially prominent in Islam, whose name means Submission; but it is also an important theme of Vaishnavite Hinduism, wherein surrender to Krishna is regarded as the core teaching of the Bhagavad Gita. The virtue of obedience to God is particularly significant in the Abrahamic religions, which envision God as a Person who acts in history and in the lives of individuals. In Eastern religions we also find passages calling us to conform to the will of Heaven and to conform our will to the nature of Ultimate Reality. </p>

Do not slay our men in Thy wrath, for, holding oblations, we call on Thee always. </p>

<p>This Ofo we have come today to consecrate you. You will start today to be effective. Anybody that has poison that can kill, any man or woman or anybody who steals and denies it, if he is brought and if this Ofo is brought and he or she swears on it may you kill him or her. Anybody that commits an incest or any other kind of abomination against the earth deity may this Ofo kill him. </p>
<p>You the holder of this Ofo, if you commit any of these crimes may this Ofo kill you. Earth goddess you have heard. Thunder you have heard. Ebirike, our ancestors have you heard? Yam goddess listen, water spirit and the spirit of the latrine, you have all heard. Be our witness today that anybody who commits abomination should die! I think I am correct? Yes! </p>

<p>May your fear of Heaven be as strong as your fear of man! </p>
<p>Judaism. Talmud, Berakot 28b </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>The fear of God is mighty and of great weight. Egoism is worthless and just vociferous. Walk under the weight of such great fear; And through Divine grace obtain knowledge of God. None crosses the ocean of existence unless he bear fear; Through fear the fear-directed life is beautified with divine love. Through fear of God, the fire of fear blazes in the human frame. Through fear of God and love is molded spiritual beauty. Without fear of God all that is uttered is misshapen and worthless-- The mold and the shaping strokes both blind.... </p>
<p>Through fear of God vanish worldly fears. The fear of God which eliminates all other fear-- how may it be called fear? No other resting place is except Thee; All that happens is Thy will. One might be afraid of it if anything other than God held any fear-- To be shaken with such fears is sheer perturbation of mind. </p>
<p>Sikhism. Adi Granth, Gauri, M.1. p. 151 </p>

<p>Svetasvatara Upanishad 4.13, 21-22: Shiva has many aspects, one of which is the God of destruction. In this fearful aspect he is worshipped in this passage from the Upanishads. Rudra is an epithet of Shiva. Igbo Consecration: The Ofo stick is a central religious symbol of the Igbos. It represents the connection between the human world and the spiritual world, and is used to connect with spiritual power, give blessings, empower curses, solemnize oaths, enforce justice, and bring the collective wisdom and power of the ancestors to bear on social and political decisions. Cf. Igbo Trial, p. 372. Berakot 28b: For a Chinese story about someone who had no fear of heaven, see Treatise on Response and Retribution, pp. 374f. Cf. Analects 3.13, p. 827. </p>

<p>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. </p>
<p>Judaism and Christianity. Proverbs 9.11 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>He in whom the fear of sin comes before wisdom, his wisdom will endure; but he in whom wisdom comes before the fear of sin, his wisdom will not endure. </p>
<p>Judaism. Mishnah, Abot 3.11 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Monks, two bright things guard the world: shame and fear of blame. If these two bright things did not guard the world... the world would fall into promiscuity, as is the case with goats, sheep, poultry, pigs, dogs, and jackals. </p>
<p>Buddhism. Itivuttaka 36 </p>
<p><hr></p>

<p>Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve. </p>
<p>Hinduism. Bhagavad Gita 18.66 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>He who submits to the yoke of the Torah liberates himself from the yoke of circumstance. He rises above the pressures of the state and above the fluctuations of worldly fortune. </p>

<p><hr></p>
<p>Abiding by your commandment is preferable to worshipping you. Obeying your commandment conduces to deliverance and contravenes from bondage. </p>
<p>Jainism. Vitaragastava 19.4 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken to the fat of rams. </p>
<p>Judaism and Christianity. Bible, 1 Samuel 15.22 </p>
<p><hr></p>

<p>Why does God require of us obedience?... Man must push away and overcome the factors of the Fall [of man]. Because the Fall originated from disobedience, God must order us to have absolute obedience as a necessary condition to restore this. Therefore in our religious way of life we cannot complain. We have no excuse; we must have absolute obedience. </p>

<p>Ritual purification, though million-fold, may not purify the mind. Nor may absorption in trance still it, however long and continuous. Possessing worlds multiple quenches not the rage of avarice and desire. A thousand million feats of intellect bring not emancipation. How then to become true to the Creator? How to demolish the wall of illusion? Through obedience to His Ordinance and Will. Says Nanak, This blessing too is pre-ordained. </p>
