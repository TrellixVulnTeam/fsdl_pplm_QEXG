<p>Lying And Deceit </p>
</b></font><p>It is said that the pen is mightier than the sword. Similarly, a lie may do more damage than a gun fired in anger. Lying is the doorway to any number of evils. But we may distinguish between lying in the sense of teaching a falsehood about Reality--e.g., propagating atheism or a false doctrine--and lying in the sense of deliberately misleading and deceiving another about a matter of which he has certain knowledge. The first type of lie may in fact be based on honest conviction; the second type of lie is deliberate deception. In this section, we have gathered passages on lying and falsehood only the latter sense of deliberate deception; untruth in the former sense may be classed as Ignorance, pp. 344-48. Even so, often there is only a short distance between ignorance about truth and lying to one's neighbor, as several passages in this section affirm. </p>

<p>You brood of vipers! how can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

<p>Confucius said, &quot;I do not see what use a man can be put to, whose word cannot be trusted. How can a wagon be made to go if it has no yoke-bar, or a carriage if it has no collar-bar?&quot; </p>
<p>Confucianism. Analects 2.22 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>The Venerable Rahula saw the Lord coming in the distance; seeing him he made ready a seat and water for washing the feet. The Lord sat down on the seat made ready; as he was sitting down he bathed his feet. And Rahula, having greeted the Lord, sat down at a respectful distance. </p>
<p>Then the Lord put a little quantity of water that was left over into the water vessel and addressed Rahula, saying, &quot;Do you, Rahula, see this little quantity of water that is left over and that is put into the water vessel?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes, revered sir.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Even so, Rahula, little is the recluseship of those who have no shame at intentional lying.&quot; </p>
<p>Then the Lord, having thrown away that little quantity of water, addressed Rahula, saying, &quot;Do you, Rahula, see this little quantity of water that has been thrown away?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes, revered sir.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Even so, Rahula, thrown away is the recluseship of those who have no shame at intentional lying.&quot; </p>
<p>Buddhism. Majjhima Nikaya i.414, Ambalatthika-Rahulovada Sutta </p>
<p>A liar lies to himself as well as to the gods. Lying is the origin of all evils; it leads to rebirth in the miserable planes of existence, to breach of the pure precepts, and to corruption of the body. </p>
