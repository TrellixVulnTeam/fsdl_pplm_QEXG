<p>Synergy </p>
</b></font><p>While Theravada Buddhism and Jainism regard progress toward enlightenment as entirely a matter of individual effort, in the theistic religions human efforts are undertaken in the context of God's grace. The relationship between effort and grace is what Thomas Aquinas called synergy: effort calls forth grace, and grace prompts effort. A number of texts stress human initiative as calling forth grace--&quot;God helps those who help themselves&quot;; conversely, others describe grace as preceding and overshadowing human effort. The concluding text describe the conjoint action of human effort and divine providence, including the paradoxical nature of their relationship. For texts that regard salvation as by grace alone, see Grace, pp. 505-12. </p>

<p>Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Or what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for fish, will give him a serpent? If you, then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him! </p>
<p>Christianity. Bible, Matthew 7.7-11 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>God has declared: I am close to the thought that My servant has of Me, and I am with him whenever He recollects Me. If he remembers Me in himself, I remember him in Myself, and if he remembers Me in a gathering I remember him better than those in the gathering do, and if he approaches Me by as much as one hand's length, I approach him by a cubit.... If he takes a step towards me, I run towards him. </p>

<p>Christianity. Revelation 3.20 </p>
<p>For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God--not because of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. </p>

<p>Lo! this is an admonishment, that whosoever will may choose a way unto his Lord; yet you will not, unless God wills. Lo! God is Knower, Wise. He makes whom He will to enter His mercy, and for evildoers has prepared a painful doom. </p>

<p>Christianity. Philippians 2.12-13 </p>

<p>All undertakings in this world depend both on the ordering of fate and on human exertion; but among these two the ways of fate are unfathomable; in the case of man's work action is possible. </p>
<p>Hinduism. Laws of Manu 7.205 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>All by Thee is accomplished, Thine is the might, Thou watcheth Thy handiwork, With chess pieces raw and ripe. All that into the world have come, must depart hence-- All shall by turns go. Why put out of mind the Lord, master of life and death? By one's own hands is one's affairs set straight. </p>
<p>Sikhism. Adi Granth, Asa-ki-Var, M.1, p. 473-74 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Lord Mahavira! Your word sometimes supports the view of providence, at other times calls events spontaneously occurring or ascribes destiny to external factors. At times you hold the deeds of individuals to be the mold of their desert, at other times find that another's deeds project their moral reflection on the individual. The miracle is that none blames you for these paradoxical utterances! </p>
<p>Jainism. Hemachandra, Dvatrimshika 3.8 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Asa-ki-Var, M.1: The image of God in heaven moving chess pieces which determine man's destiny on earth is evocative of absolute predestination. Yet that is all the more reason to be mindful of God, Master of the game; for who knows on what basis he decides his moves, or whether he will not choose to move the pieces again? </p>
