<p>Preparing The Start </p>
</b></font><p>If any venture is to succeed, it must begin well. The Oriental proverb, well begun is half done, describes the theme of the passages in this section. A good beginning means, first of all, internal preparation. A person should purify his heart prior to starting any venture; furthermore, he must steel himself with firm resolution and gather sufficient means to bear any and all burdens on the way to the goal. This is practical advice, but it applies especially to activity in the spiritual quest: It should not be embarked upon lightly or frivolously, lest the aspirant fall into straits worse than where he was when he started. </p>

<p>The superior man does not embark upon any affair until he has carefully planned the start. </p>

<p>Success is the result of foresight and resolution; foresight depends upon deep thinking and planning to keep your secrets to yourself. </p>

<p>One must not stand up and say the Tefillah except in a serious frame of mind. The pious men of old used to wait an hour, and then say the prayer, in order to direct their hearts to their Father in Heaven. </p>

Berakot 5.1: The 'Tefillah' refers to the Amidah, or Eighteen Benedictions, one of the central daily prayers of Judaism. Cf. Berakot 30b, p. 829. </p>

<p>For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, saying, &quot;This man began to build, and was not able to finish.&quot; Or what king, going to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? </p>
<p>Christianity. Luke 14.28-31 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>A ship, which is not well prepared, in the ocean Goes to destruction, together with its goods and merchants. But when a ship is well prepared, and well joined together, Then it does not break up, and all the goods get to the other shore. Just so a bodhisattva, exalted in faith, But deficient in wisdom, swiftly comes to a failure in enlightenment. But when he is well joined to wisdom, the foremost perfection, He experiences, unharmed and uninjured, the enlightenment of the Jinas. </p>

<p>Woodworker Ch'ing carved a piece of wood and made a bell stand, and when it was finished, everyone who saw it marveled, for it seemed to be the work of gods or spirits. When the Marquis of Lu saw it, he asked, &quot;What art is it you have?&quot; Ch'ing replied, &quot;I am only a craftsman--how would I have any art? There is one thing, however. When I am going to make a bell stand, I never let it wear out my energy. I always fast in order to still my mind. When I have fasted for three days, I no longer have any thought of congratulations or rewards, of titles or stipends. When I have fasted for five days, I no longer have any thought of praise or blame, of skill or clumsiness. And when I have fasted seven days, I am so still that I forget I have four limbs and a form and body. By that time, the ruler and his court no longer exist for me. My skill is concentrated and all outside distractions fade away. After that, I go into the mountain forest and examine the Heavenly nature of the trees. If I find one of superlative form, and I can see a bell stand there, I put my hand to the job of carving; if not, I let it go. This way I am simply matching up 'Heaven' with 'Heaven.' That's probably the reason that people wonder if the results were not made by spirits.&quot; </p>
