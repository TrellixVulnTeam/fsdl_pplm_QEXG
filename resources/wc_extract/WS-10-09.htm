<p>Peace </p>
</b></font><p>Peace is one of the most desirable fruits of salvation in all the world's religions. We begin with passages describing the fruit of inner peace. The peace that comes with reaching Ultimate Reality brings tranquillity to the heart and clarity to the mind. It is the absence of passions, desires, anxieties, and wandering thoughts; the heart becomes cool and content. Nirvana is often translated 'Peace.' Islam and Christianity both praise the peace and tranquillity that come to the soul that is firm in faith. The soul of the saint has been likened to a deep pond whose surface remains undisturbed by waves despite the many currents or streams that flow into it. </p>
<p>A second group of passages describe the peace of God that brings harmony among people and nations. Outward peace is emphasized in the Abrahamic faiths, for whom the work of God has a social and historical dimension. The love of God breaks down the walls of hostility between people, and thus becomes the foundation for their lasting peace. Yet peace in this social and political sense is not only given by God; it must also be built by the efforts of human beings. Those who are blessed with inner peace have the responsibility to become peacemakers, reconciling conflict. </p>

<p><hr></p>
<p>This is peace, this is the excellent, namely the calm of all the impulses, the casting out of all &quot;basis,&quot; the extinction of craving, dispassion, stopping, Nirvana. </p>
<p>Buddhism. Anguttara Nikaya v.322 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>O tranquil soul, return to your Lord so pleasant and well-pleased! Enter among My servants and enter My garden! </p>

<p>Anguttara Nikaya v.322: Nirvana is the Ultimate Good because it is the complete end of all the impulses and passions that produce evil. Cf. Dhammapada 96, p. 230. Qur'an 89.27-30: Cf. Qur'an 56.27, p. 353. Numbers 6.26: Part of the Aaronic benediction, Numbers 6.24-26, p. 56. </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Just as a deep lake is clear and still, even so, on hearing the teachings and realizing them, the wise become exceedingly peaceful. </p>
<p>Buddhism. Dhammapada 82 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>As rivers flow into the ocean but cannot make the vast ocean overflow, so flow the streams of the sense-world into the sea of peace that is the sage. </p>
<p>Hinduism. Bhagavad Gita 2.70 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Men do not mirror themselves in running water--they mirror themselves in still water. Only what is still can still the stillness of other things. </p>
<p>Taoism. Chuang Tzu 5 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>The monk looks for peace within himself, and not in any other place. For when a person is inwardly quiet, there is nowhere a self can be found; where, then, could a non-self be found? </p>
<p>There are no waves in the depths of the sea; it is still, unbroken. It is the same with the monk. He is still, without any quiver of desire, without a remnant on which to build pride and desire. </p>
<p>Buddhism. Sutta Nipata 919-20 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>The Lord lives in the heart of every creature. He turns them round and round upon the wheel of his Maya. Take refuge utterly in Him. By His grace you will find supreme peace, and the state which is beyond all change. </p>
<p>Hinduism. Bhagavad Gita 18.61-62 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Should anyone be victim of great anxiety, his body racked with maladies, Beset with problems of home and family, With pleasure and pain alternating, Wandering in all four directions without peace or rest-- Should he then contemplate the Supreme Being, Peaceful shall his mind and body become. </p>
<p>Sikhism. Adi Granth, Sri Raga, M.5, p. 70 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Dhammapada 82: Cf. Anguttara Nikaya iii.34, p. 531; Dhammapada 413, pp. 231f. Bhagavad Gita 2.70: Cf. Bhagavad Gita 6.7-9, p. 226. Chuang Tzu 5: Only a person at peace with himself can calm others. Cf. Tao Te Ching 4, p. 525; Great Learning, p. 842; Tao Te Ching 56, p. 840. Sutta Nipata 919-920: Cf. Dhammapada 279, p. 899. The peace which comes from finding union in the midst of the world's bewildering diversity is also expressed in the Peace Chant of the Isha Upanishad, p. 55. Cf. Katha Upanishad 3.13, p. 840, Bhagavad Gita 5.10-12, p. 724. On the wheel of Maya, see Svetasvatara Upanishad 1.6.8, p. 398. </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Victory breeds hatred, for the defeated live in pain. Happily live the peaceful, giving up victory and defeat. </p>
<p>Buddhism. Dhammapada 201 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Tao invariably takes no action, and yet there is nothing left undone. If kings and barons can keep it, all things will transform spontaneously. If, after transformation, they should desire to be active, I would restrain them with simplicity, which has no name. Simplicity, which has no name, is free of desires. Being free of desires, it is tranquil. And the world will be at peace of its own accord. </p>
<p>Taoism. Tao Te Ching 37 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Some children were playing beside a river. They made castles of sand, and each child defended his castle and said, &quot;This one is mine.&quot; They kept their castles separate and would not allow any mistakes about which was whose. When the castles were all finished, one child kicked over someone else's castle and completely destroyed it. The owner of the castle flew into a rage, pulled the other child's hair, struck him with his fist and bawled out, &quot;He has spoiled my castle! Come along all of you and help me to punish him as he deserves.&quot; The others all came to his help. They beat the child with a stick and then stamped on him as he lay on the ground.... Then they went on playing in their sand castles, each saying, &quot;This is mine; no one else may have it. Keep away! Don't touch my castle!&quot; But evening came, it was getting dark and they all thought they ought to be going home. No one now cared what became of his castle. One child stamped on his, another pushed his over with both hands. Then they turned away and went back, each to his home. </p>

Yogacara Bhumi Sutra 4: In this parable Nirvana is likened to the diminution of jealousy and passion for existence with the cool of evening. In the Pali version (Samyutta Nikaya iii.188) the sand castles are likened to the body, which had been the object of grasping; with Release it becomes a thing to be disregarded and broken up. Luke 2.14: The proclamation of the angelic hosts at the birth of Jesus, the Prince of Peace; see the larger passage Luke 1.26-2:14, p. 596. Cf. Yasna 60.5, p. 289. </p>
