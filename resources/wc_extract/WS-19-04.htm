<p>Giving And Receiving </p>
</b></font><p>Passages in this section express the general spiritual principle of giving and receiving. When we give to one another, freely and without conditions, sharing our blessings with others and bearing each other's burdens, the giving multiplies and we receive far more than what was given. Even when there is no immediate prospect of return, Heaven keeps accounts of giving, and in the end blessing will return to the giver, multiplied manyfold. We must give first; to expect to receive without having given is to violate the universal law. On the other hand, giving in order to receive--with strings attached, with the intention of currying favor, or in order to make a name for oneself--is condemned. See also The Golden Rule, pp. 172-74. </p>

<p>Buddhism. Itivuttaka 18 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>The Buddha said, &quot;When you see someone practicing the Way of giving, aid him joyously, and you will obtain vast and great blessings.&quot; A shramana asked: &quot;Is there an end to those blessings?&quot; The Buddha said, &quot;Consider the flame of a single lamp. Though a hundred thousand people come and light their own lamps from it so that they can cook their food and ward off the darkness, the first lamp remains the same as before. Blessings are like this, too.&quot; </p>

<p>He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor; his righteousness endures forever. </p>

<p>Giving simply because it is right to give, without thought of return, at a proper time, in proper circumstances, and to a worthy person, is enlightened giving. Giving with regrets or in the expectation of receiving some favor or of getting something in return, is selfish giving. </p>

<p>Mencius said, &quot;A man who is out to make a name for himself will be able to give away a state of a thousand chariots, but reluctance would be written all over his face if he had to give away a basketful of rice and a bowlful of soup when no such purpose was served.&quot; </p>

<p>Unification Church. Sun Myung Moon, 12-5-71 </p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life 8.125: This distinction between gods and demons is made in Satapatha Brahmana 5.1.1.1-2, p. 383. Book of Songs, Ode 64: It is commonplace for people to give gifts with the intention of securing a favor in return. In such calculations, the gift and its return would be of roughly equal value. To return a gift of immensely greater value might burden the recipient with a feeling of indebtedness. This passage, however, describes an exchange of gifts with a purer motive: friendship that goes beyond the calculations of obligation. </p>
